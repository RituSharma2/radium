# AXIOS Get request

- ABOUT AXIOS- a package that helps us hit any external api and fetch data from that api


- create options object with method and url
- await axios(options)
- data will be mostly available in response.data

# post request:
- method changed to post
- data field added in options


# Assignment:
GOTO  http://api.openweathermap.org => “subscribe” current weather data ==> get api key for Free version ==> create new account and Verify your emailId( Must verify to avoid issues) => go to My APi keys under your account name(top right corner) or https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys => save the key/appid somewhere. Now proceed further

- get weather of London from http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=<useYourOwnAppId>  (NOTE: must use HTTP infront of the url else axios will attempt to hit localhost and give error  ..also use HTTP only and not HTTPS)
- then change the above to get the temperature only( of London)
- Sort the cities  ["Bengaluru","Mumbai", "Delhi", "Kolkata", "Chennai", "London", "Moscow"] in order of their increasing temperature
result should look something like this
[
{city:"London", temp: 280},
{city:"Moscow", temp: 290},
{city:"Bangalore", temp: 301.2},
.......
